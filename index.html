    <p><strong>Who I Am:</strong>  
   My name is  <strong>ANTHONY CHUKWUEBUKA OMEH</strong><br> I'm an aspiring Full Stack Engineer who is passionate about technology, creativity, and problem-solving.<br> I believe technology is more than just code, it’s a way to build solutions that improve lives and connect people globally.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why I Am Learning Full Stack Engineering:</strong>  
    I chose Full Stack Engineering because I want to understand the complete picture of how web applications works,<br> from the design that users see (front-end) to the logic that powers it (back-end).<br> Learning both sides gives me the power to build complete, functional, and user-friendly applications without depending solely on one skill set.<br> I’m also excited about the opportunities it opens in the tech world, from freelancing to building startups.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why Technology?</strong>  
    Technology is the backbone of modern life.<br>Every industry, from healthcare to education to entertainment runs on tech.<br>By equipping myself with these skills, I’m preparing to be part of the future, creating tools that can simplify processes, solve real problems, and make the world more connected.</p>
      <p><strong>My Goals:</strong>  
    My short-term goal is to master the foundations of web development and create projects that showcase my skills.<br> In the long term, I want to become a well-rounded Full Stack Engineer who contributes to open-source projects, mentors upcoming developers, and eventually builds scalable applications that can impact businesses and communities.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why This Journey Matters:</strong>  
    For me, this journey is not just about writing code.<br> It’s about proving to myself that with dedication and consistency, I can achieve expertise in one of the most in-demand skills in the world.<br>It’s about growth, resilience, and the drive to keep learning. Every line of code I write today takes me one step closer to my dream of becoming a professional software engineer.</p>
